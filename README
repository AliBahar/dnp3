A DNP3 parser implementation in Hammer 

 * https://github.com/UpstandingHackers/hammer

 * needs the 'h_bind' combinator as implemented in
   https://github.com/pesco/hammer/tree/h_bind

 * 'make' builds

 * './test' runs the test suite (uses the Glib test framework)


NOTES:

 A) This implementation is based on IEEE Std. 1815-2012 and notably
    AN2013-004b.

 B) This is an application-oriented implementation of DNP3. Nonconforming
    input is discarded immediately and not processed. The focus is on
    recognizing expected input as opposed to inspecting erroneous input.
   
    In the same vein, semantic representation is relatively high-level and does
    not insist on mirroring packet structure where details are irrelevant to a
    user of the protocol.

 C) Reserved bits are _required_ to be 0 unless the standard explicitly
    allows them to be ignored.
